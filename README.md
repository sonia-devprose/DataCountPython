This repository demonstrates a Python script that showcases multiple key programming concepts, including:

1. **Function Definitions**: The script defines a function `square` to square numbers and a lambda function `multiply` to multiply two numbers.
2. **List and Tuple Operations**: A list of integers is processed to create a new list of squared numbers. Additionally, a tuple is defined and printed.
3. **Counting Element Occurrences**: The script includes an example of counting the occurrences of each element in a list using Python's `collections.Counter` class, providing a straightforward way to analyze data frequencies in a list.

This example is suitable for Python beginners who are learning how to define functions, use lambda expressions, work with lists and tuples, and perform data analysis with the `Counter` class from the `collections` module.
